# Amazon Clone using HTML and CSS



## Introduction

Hello, everyone! My name is Goutham, and I've created an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS. This project aims to replicate the look and feel of Amazon.com, offering a similar user interface for product listings. However, please note that this clone is not fully responsive or interactive yet.

## Project Overview

The Amazon clone is a front-end project that focuses on mimicking the design and layout of the Amazon website. It has been developed using HTML and CSS only, without any JavaScript or server-side functionalities. As a result, certain interactive features present on the actual Amazon website may not be available in this clone.

## Features

1. Product Listings: The clone displays product listings with product images, titles, prices, and ratings. Users can browse through the available products.

2. Basic Styling: The project includes basic CSS styling to make the interface resemble the Amazon website.

## Limitations

1. **Responsiveness**: The clone is not fully responsive, meaning it may not adapt well to different screen sizes or devices. It's currently optimized for desktop view.

2. **Interactivity**: As mentioned earlier, this clone lacks interactive features like dynamic filtering, product details, add-to-cart functionality, and user authentication.

## Getting Started

To run the Amazon clone locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub

2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd Amazon-clone`

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the Amazon clone.

## Future Enhancements

While this project currently serves as a basic representation of Amazon's front-end, there are several improvements and enhancements that could be made:

1. **Responsiveness**: Implement a responsive design to ensure a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

2. **Interactivity**: Integrate JavaScript to enable dynamic product filtering, product details modal, and a functional shopping cart.

3. **Backend Integration**: Connect the front-end to a server-side backend to handle user authentication, product data, and shopping cart functionality.

4. **Payment Processing**: Add payment processing integration to simulate the checkout process.
